# Cohort Exercise  - Code based testing


## Total 10 Marks


## Question 1 (4 marks)

Let's consider the example 

```js
function gcd(x,y) {
  let r = null;
  if ((x < 1) || (y < 1)) {
    r = null;
  } else {
    while (x != y) {
      if (x > y) {
        let t = x - y;
        x = y;
        y = t
      } else {
        let t = y - x;
        y = x;
        x = t;
      }
    }
    r = x;
  }
  return r;
}
```

1. construct the CFG of the above program.
1. find the cyclomatic complexity of the CFG.
1. generate the test cases to cover all paths.
1. generate extra test cases (if needed) to attain MCDC coverage.
1. verify your test cases's coverage using jest (though it is only up to edge coverage)


## Question 2 (2 marks)

Given an input string, implement a mutation operator that chooses a random position in the string and swaps the adjacent characters. Meaning if `SUTD` is an input string and 2 is chosen as the random position, the output should be `SUDT`. Careful about the string length bound check. 

## Question 3 (4 marks)

Use JavaScript to implement a fuzzer that will randomly generate inputs to the calculator conforming to the grammar. 

```
S ::= Expr
Expr ::= Expr + Term | Expr - Term | Term
Term ::= Term * Factor | Term / Factor | Factor
Factor ::= -Integer | (Expr) | Integer | Integer.Integer
Integer ::= Digit | IntegerDigit
Digit ::=  0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 
```

For now, you can hardcode the expression grammar. 

Hint: Start with the initial rule `S ::= Expr` and at each point, apply a rule at random. For example, randomly choose any of the rules `Expr ::= Term`, `Expr ::= Expr + Term` or `Expr â€“ Term` in the next step. Continue until a valid expression for the calculator is obtained. Make sure you do not expand the rules forever to avoid infinite loop.
